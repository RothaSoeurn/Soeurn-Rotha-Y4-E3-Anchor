    <h1 id="section1">Kampong Cham province
    </h1>

    <p>
        Kampong Cham (Khmer: កំពង់ចាម, UNGEGN: Kâmpóng Cham [kɑmpɔŋ caːm]; lit. 'Cham Port') is a province of Cambodia
        located on the central lowlands of the Mekong River. It borders the provinces of Kampong Chhnang to the west,
        Kampong Thom and Kratié to the north, Tboung Khmum to the east, and Prey Veng and Kandal to the south. Kampong
        Cham was officially divided into two provinces on 31 December 2013 in what was seen by many as a political move
        by the ruling party.[2][3] All land west of the Mekong remained Kampong Cham while land east of the river became
        Tbong Khmum province. Prior to this division, Kampong Cham extended eastward to the international border with
        Vietnam, was the eleventh largest province in Cambodia, and with a population of 1,680,694, was the most
        populous province in Cambodia. Its capital and largest city is Kampong Cham.

        Chamm", Later, the sound changed to "Kampong Cham" in Khmer. Kampong means port or harbor. Chamm refers to the
        "Waiting". A symbol the province is known for is two snakes sinuously wrapped around each other, which is
        located at the capital city bridge, Kampong Cham.

    <h1 id="selection5">Administration</h1>
    <p>
        Kampong Cham is subdivided into 9 districts and 1 municipality which in turn are subdivided into communes (khum)
        which are further divided into villages (phum).[5] The province formerly consisted of 16 districts, however a
        request by Hun Sen's government to split the province in two was made after his ruling Cambodian People's Party
        (CPP) lost the province to the opposition in the July 2013 elections.[3] The CPP won only eight of the available
        18 National Assembly seats in Hun Sen's home province. The request, which was ostensibly made in order to
        improve administrative efficiency in the large province, was approved by King Sihamoni on 31 December 2013. The
        10 districts that remain in Kampong Cham province overwhelmingly voted for the opposition Cambodia National
        Rescue Party, led by Sam Rainsy, while five of the six districts cut out from Kampong Cham to form Tboung Khmum
        province were won solidly by the CPP.[2]
